# Get AMX Natives
This lua code parses the amx P-Code binary generated by pawn. 

It parses the code and turns it into an assembly, it captures native functions and strings

As I'm new to this, the code may not be very good, but it was the best I could do

This served as a study of binary, P-Code, Assembly, disassemble, and lua. 

I don't know if this code can be useful to you, but for me it was really useful, I'll leave it here if you want to use of analyze or study
